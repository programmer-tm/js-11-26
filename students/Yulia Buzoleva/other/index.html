    <p class="text">Allan Rivlin, a senior vice president with Peter Hart 
        Research, says today young people are more involved with their society 
        and know what's happening. He notes, 'They're paying attention to the 
        Iraq war'. The young people surveyed also expressed concern over the 
        employment and recession situation in America. But Rivlin says their 
        greatest area of apprehension 'has to do with issues like gay marriage 
        and abortion'. These social issues topped the list of concerns among the 
        young. 'Overwhelmingly students say they have good relations with their 
        family', says Rivlin, 'and when we ask them to pick a role model, it's 
        not sports stars or entertainment figures that get picked most. Fifty-one 
        percent say their parents are their role model. Also notable, the researcher 
        says, is the fact that 'for the first time we see dads catching up with moms' 
        in terms of who the young people name as their role models.
