'The Kids Aren't Alright' is a song by The Offspring. It is the fifth track from the band's fifth studio album Americana (1998) and was released as the third single from the album. It became another top 10 hit on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Its title is an allusion to the Who song 'The Kids Are Alright' (from My Generation). Despite not being as commercially successful as its predecessor singles, 'The Kids Aren't Alright' remains the most-listened to Offspring song amongst Last.FM[8] users, and still receives some radio play. The song was used in the opening scene of the film The Faculty, and appears on the soundtrack album.[9] It is also available as downloadable content for the Rock Band video game series.[10]

The song also appears as the ninth track on their Greatest Hits album of 2005.</textarea>
